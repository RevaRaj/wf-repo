I've used CTE's(Common Table Expressions) to make the query easily readable and understandable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  Question1:   We want to list the names and gold medal count of all athletes with three or more gold medals over all games, 
--               starting with the ones with the most gold medals.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        
        -- Collecting total gold medal by each athlete in summber and winter games

		with winter_summer as (
			select a.id, a.name,sum(sg.gold) as gold_medal  from athletes a 
			inner join summer_games sg on a.id= sg.athlete_id
			group by a.id
			
			union all
			
			select a.id, a.name,sum(wg.gold) as gold_medal from athletes a 
			inner join winter_games wg  on a.id= wg.athlete_id
			group by a.id
		)


		-- Filtering the athletes based on their gold medal count with atleast 3 and highest god medal athelete at the top

			select name,gold_medal as golde_medal_count from winter_summer 
			group by id 
			having sum(gold_medal)>=3
			order by gold_medal desc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  Question2:  For each region, we want to show the region average of the second tallest athlete of each country over all games.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        --	Collecting all the athelets and their country details

		with athlete_country as (

            select sg.athlete_id, sg.country_id  from summer_games sg 

            union

            select wg.athlete_id, wg.country_id  from winter_games wg 

		),

		-- Based on the country details of the atheletes gathering their region and height

		athlete_height as (

            select ac.athlete_id, ac.country_id,c.region, a.height from athlete_country ac
            inner join athletes a on a.id =ac.athlete_id
            inner join countries c on ac.country_id = c.id

		),

		--	Ordering the athlets based on their height 

		height_ranking as (

			select * , row_number() over  (partition by country_id
										  order by height desc) as rank
			from athlete_height

		),


		-- fetching the 2nd tallest athlete

		second_tallest as (

			select athlete_id, height,country_id, region
			from height_ranking where rank=2

		),

		--	Calculating number of 2nd tallest athletes in each region

		athlete_count_region as (

			select count(athlete_id) as athlete_count,region  from second_tallest
			group by region
			
		)

		-- Finding the regional average which is 16
		 
			select sum(athlete_count)/count(region) as region_avg
			from athlete_count_region;
